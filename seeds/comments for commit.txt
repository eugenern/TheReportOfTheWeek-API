Energy Drink Reviews:

#1: references past experience (but with orange flavor) lasting 2.5 hours and predicts that this flavor performs similarly
#2: references past experience lasting 6 hours
#5: references past experience lasting either 2 hours or 10 minutes ("I tried one at 8, okay, I'm asleep in [at?] 10")
#6: references past experience lasting from 8 to 12, as well as saying "probably a good four or five hours"
#8: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says "finished it off at around 8", "up until…midnight, 1, maybe 2, even, no, 1, 1, I'm saying 1", and "so that lasted…7 hours". Kind of confusing, since even 8-2 is only a 6 hour span. I decided on 5 because he seemed to settle on 8 to 1.
#9: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says "a good 6, 7, 7½ hours". Wasn't sure what to do here, chose 7 because it was the median of the figures he threw out there.
#11: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says "finished it off at…6 and I was up until around midnight" and "lasted for…4, 5 hours, maybe 5½", and settles on 5½.

#19: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says it lasted from 6 to 11 and for 5 hours, so no ambiguity except for the fact that he had to go to sleep early for some reason.

#23: since Reviewbrah had 2 drinks this time, it's unclear which drink contributed how much, but in the next video he gives credit to both for keeping him up from 11:30 to 6. I put 6 hours because he gave that figure multiple times.
#24: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says "about 6 hours, I'd say. 6, 5 hours", so I averaged the two. He also says he was up until 3, but not what time he drank it.
#25: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says 6 hours; no ambiguity here.
#26: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says 5 hours, which checks out because he drank it around midnight and stayed up to 5.
#27: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says he didn't finish the drink and stayed up for 4 hours, and predicted that the whole drink would keep one up for 5. I went with 5, but it's debateable.
#29: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says the drink kept him up from 11 to 6, but calculates that to be 8 hours. I went with 7.
#30: in the next Energy Crisis, Reviewbrah says he drank it at 8 and was up to "around 2, 3" for a total of 6 hours. Strangely, at the end of the video in which he actually drank it, he gave the time as 6:53. So 7 hours could be closer.
